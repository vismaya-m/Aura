### Project Description
Aura Enhancement AI is your ✨unhinged digital coach✨ that scans your aura, roasts your vibe, and delivers brutally honest (and occasionally terrible)advice to help you glow up — spiritually, emotionally, and aesthetically. Think of it as a TikTok baddie meets a sassy oracle, ready to drag your energy and send you on a chaotic self-improvement journey you didn’t ask for. Whether you're radiating main character energy or straight-up NPC chaos, this app will call you out, hype you up, and maybe even change your life… or at least your Instagram bio. 💀💅🔮



### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Society is suffering from a vibe crisis. People's auras are completely unregulated — walking around with zero self-awareness, unmatched energy levels, and spiritual WiFi that’s straight-up disconnected. No one knows if they’re radiating ✨main character energy✨ or just giving ✨cringe-core chaos✨. There’s no government-mandated aura scanner. No hotline for delulu emergencies. No AI therapist brave enough to tell you that your glow-up arc is still loading. Until now. 💀

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a sassy, semi-judgmental AI that scans your aura, roasts your vibe, and drops unsolicited advice with the energy of a chaotic TikTok life coach on three shots of espresso. It’s not here to fix you — it’s here to expose you, vibe-check you, and then scream “SLAY” as you spiral into self-awareness. 💀✨

Whether you’re radiating ✨delulu energy✨ or rocking full-on ✨feral mode✨, this app gives you a personalized roast, a chaotic aura score, and the kind of terrible advice you’d normally get from your most unqualified friend. It’s the glow-up guidance you never needed — but somehow can’t stop clicking
