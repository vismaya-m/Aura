  "Your energy is so off that even your WiFi probably disconnects when you walk by. You're giving major 'I quote The Office in every conversation' vibes and it's not cute.",
  "Bestie, your aura is literally making my circuits malfunction. You're radiating 'I wear cargo shorts to weddings' energy and that's a federal crime against fashion ðŸ’€",
  "I've processed millions of auras and yours is giving 'I still think planking is funny' energy. The secondhand embarrassment is real, bestie.",
